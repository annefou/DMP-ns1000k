        <h3 class="question">1.2 Please provide a description of your project</h3>
      <div class="canned">This project aims at developing a fully integrated computing framework for running Geosciences applications. Many scientists in Geosciences are still reluctant to use HPC resources, therefore being able to provide users with appropriate support is vital. When users have such expertise, they however spend a lot of time to set-up the same models on the same machines. Therefore, it is important not only to optimize user applications or models but to give an appropriate framework for running large simulations. The current bottleneck for most applications in Geosciences is to define efficient workflows (fetching input data, running parallel models, storing outputs data with data exploration facilities). In this project we aim at developing such framework for a range of known applications: openIFS (ECMWF forecast model), FLEXPART transport model (“FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model”), MITgcm (MIT General Circulation Model), WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting), ENKI (hydrological modelling toolbox and a hydrological forecasting system), CESM (Community Earth System Model) and ad-hoc user codes developed at the Geosciences Department. This framework will be used both for research and teaching (for instance GEF 4530 at the University of Oslo). We have successfully installed most of these applications on the targeted computing platforms and have started to write workflows in python scripting language. We will now continue our effort and put emphasis on how best use NorStore facilities in these workflows (and also for data exploration) as most of these models require a large volume of input data and generate large outputs to be analyzed.</div>

      <div class="canned">Data management activities related to EOSC-Nordic are funded by EOSC-Nordic (staffing) while core activities related to education of students and researchers are funded by the department of Geosciences.

For each folder, data creators are expected to generate a README file with a minimum information on the datasets. We encourage users to use the following template: https://cornell.app.box.com/v/ReadmeTemplate

Data are archived as soon as possible i.e. as soon as consolidated datasets are produced: then these datasets become readonly (permissions changed on NIRD project area) and kept on NS1000K until scientists (or students) give their approval for removing data. Emails are sent every 6 months to all data "creators" so that we can get up to date information about their datasets.

For publication, plots, codes (to generate plots) are sometimes added to the archive.

Archiving after the end of a project is funded by the department of Geosciences.</div>

  <h2>2. Data</h2>
  
  <div class="section-introduction">This section covers the data that your project will create or use.</div>
  
  <div class="canned_answers">
  
    
    <div class="answer">
        <h3 class="question">2.1 Please describe how your project will create and/or reuse data.</h3>
      <div class="canned">- Most data are Climate data (gridded data in netCDF format, following CF conventions) downloaded from ESGF nodes or from Copernicus Climate Data Store. These data can be easily retrieved again (it take a very long time but it is possible). netCDF format using CF-convention is standard within the Climate Science community.

- observations: Different formats and provenance: BUFR, HDF5, netCDF, csv, textfile or binary (direct from instrument). Field observations are copied by individual researchers and the researcher will only published (archive in NIRD archive) datasets once the associated scientific publication is accepted in a journal. This means that there is usually a period of time during which the dataset is not used on the NIRD project and not archived yet (between 6 months to 1 years). When the format is not standard, decoded/cleaned datasets are usually archived along with the raw data.

- containers: in the framework of reproducible research containers used for running Earth System Models (NorESM, CESM, WACCM) are also stored in the NIRD project area (docker &amp; singularity containers with intel compilers). Because we use intel compilers (and these compilers are part of the containers), we cannot make them publicly available. In a near future, all our containers will be provided with GNU compilers so that they can be made publicly available. We are planning to set-up (2021) a service similar to bio.tools but for the climate community. The procedures related to containers on NS1000K will then be reviewed (as much as possible containers will be archived).

- personal files (related to individual research work, in particular master's students. To obtain their master thesis, master student needs to clear their storage area (remove unecessary files and archive data that need to be kept). Each master's student write a DMP (very simplified version that is mostly a README file as mentioned above). The Data manager of NS1000K has currently no possibility to review these DMPs and needs to trust master's students.</div>

    <div class="answer">
        <h3 class="question">3.2 What data quality measures will you use for your data?</h3>
      <div class="canned">- Climate data that are downloaded from ESGF / Copernicus data store are not checked by us because they are already check by the data provider (data is coming from authoritative climate providers)

- raw data (observations) are not quality checked: raw data are meant to be archived without being manipulated. The only check we do is related to the filesize / checksum.
- Data (observations, researcher model runs, etc.) come along with a scientific publications where any quality control procedures will be described. Quality control procedures depend on the variables (temperature, winds, etc.) and instruments. Full reference to use quality procedure is mentioned in the publications associated to the dataset.

- For climate data generated by NorESM, we are working on the standardization of all the variables (same as it is done during CMIP). However, we will also always archive raw data for future reference.</div>
